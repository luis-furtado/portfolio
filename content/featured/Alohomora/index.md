Alohomora is a system idealized for the management of gatehouses in condominiums and buildings that aims to solve problems of cost with gatehouses and provide autonomy to residents.

The system has a voice biometrics tool, making the resident's voice become their own key. Such functionality makes the use of passwords secondary.

Developed a voice biometric authentication system using MFCC and FastDTW.
